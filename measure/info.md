# Measure

This folder contains methods and scripts for taking automated measurements, including
helpers that are used at the various stages, like force feedback, computer vision and
other factors that contribute to making EO automated measurements.

## Measurement API

This can be thought of as a direct application of the managers, and the measurement API.
This is intended to be a set of helper scripts that can be used as the building blocks
for future automated testing and branching which can either be used as part of the GUI,
or as a Python API.
